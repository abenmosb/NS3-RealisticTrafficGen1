# NS3-RealisticTrafficGen
The project includes implementations of a realistic mobile traffic generator based on real cellular traces. 
The files should be executed in NS3 simulator. 
lte-load-profile-management.cc and lte-load-profile-management.h should be added to the NS3 lte module as a new class files. 
scenario-example-real-traces.cc is basic example of simulation scenario showing how to exploit the traffic generator.
